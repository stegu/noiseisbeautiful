Please respect the license terms. I spent a lot of time writing and illustrating this, and I only ask you to give credit by not editing out my name and the license information from the text. Any non-commercial use is allowed by the license without any additional permission from me, including excerpts, modifications, translations and redistribution, as long as you state the source clearly and include the license information. If you wish to use the book in whole or in part for commercial purposes, contact me. I'm reasonable, but I don't want you to make money on my work without me getting at least some small share of it.

If you find use for the book, please let me know in the "Issues" section. Non-problems are welcome there as well.

I couldn't place a copy of the book on Github, because the file was too large, but here's a
[Dropbox link](https://www.dropbox.com/scl/fi/b8rt7kxn8v4swaabiecyb/noiseisbeautiful.pdf?rlkey=7jqnigdyds7rkxo6w6e9452op&dl=0)
in case the DOI repository is down. (It usually isn't.)
